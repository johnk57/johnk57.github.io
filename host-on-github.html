    <u>To host your website for free on github:</u>
    <p><u><br>
      </u></p>
    <p>1) Have your parents create an account for you at: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/"><br>
      </a></p>
    <p>2) When you're logged in, click here to create a new repository: <a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/new"><br>
      </a></p>
    <p>3) You have to name the repository <em style="color: #000099;">username</em><span
        style="color: #000099;">.github.io</span>, where <em>username</em> is
      your username on github.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>4) Don't worry if it takes you to a page with instructions for cloning
      the repository. Instead, once it's created, go to the repository which
      will be at: <span style="color: #000099;">https://github.com/<em>username</em>/<em>username</em>.github.io</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bookmark that page, because that's where to upload your website files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    5) Click the "<span style="color: #000099;">Add file</span>" dropdown menu
    and choose "<span style="color: #000099;">Upload files</span>" and upload
    your .html file. You have to scroll down and click "<span style="color: #000099;">Commit
      changes</span>" to complete the upload.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If your file is named "<span style="color: #000099;">index.html</span>"
        then it will automatically load whenever anyone visits your site, which
        will be at: <span style="color: #000099;">https://<em>username</em>.github.io/</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>If your file name is named anything else, then you can view it online
        at <span style="color: #000099;">https://<em>username</em>.github.io/<em>filename</em>.html</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>You'll also have to upload any images used in your website.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>It may take a few minutes until your website is viewable.</li>
    </ul>
